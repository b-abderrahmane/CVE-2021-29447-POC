# CVE-2021-29447-POC

## About

This script automates the required steps to exploit [https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-29447](CVE-2021-29447) in the media upload funnctionality in Wordpress and use it to extract files vi an XXE.

## Usage

```
 ./generate_payloads.py --help
usage: generate_payloads.py [-h] [--local-ip LOCAL_IP] [--local-port LOCAL_PORT] [--media-payload MEDIA_PAYLOAD] [--dtd-payload DTD_PAYLOAD]
                            [--files-to-fetch FILES_TO_FETCH [FILES_TO_FETCH ...]]

CVE-2021-29447 payload generator

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --local-ip LOCAL_IP   Local machine IP address
  --local-port LOCAL_PORT
                        Local machine port which will run an HTTP server to receive the exfiltrated files
  --media-payload MEDIA_PAYLOAD
                        Name of the .wav file containing the exploit to be generated
  --dtd-payload DTD_PAYLOAD
                        Name of the .dtd file containing the exploit to be generated
  --files-to-fetch FILES_TO_FETCH [FILES_TO_FETCH ...]
```

The script does the following:

- First step: It generates a .wav payload you need to upload to the target server. You can use `--media-payload` to pass its name.
- Second step: It generates a DTD document which will be server via an http server locally. You can use `--dtd-payload` to pass its name. This file will contain the absolute paths of the files you would like to extract from the target machine, you can specific a list of comma separated files via `--files-to-fetch`
- Third step: It runs a simple Python HTTP server to which the `.wav` payload will connect back to both to fetch the second part of the payload (the DTD document) and to send the fetched files from the remote system.
- Fourth step: If all of the files you specified exist on the remote filesystem, these files will be sent back to the HTTP server in a B64 encoded format, the script will then decode them and save them to your current working directory.
